There are only two requests which don't require authorization headers.

All dependecies related to database management, server management, security management and so on, will be automatically injected by Maven using the pom.xml file located in the root folder of the project.

## Installation

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

    
## Run Locally

`PROFILE`

`MYSQL_URL`

`MYSQL_USER`

`MYSQL_PASS`



## Deployment
To deploy this project run

## Usage/Examples

You can use a demo version of the app, using SwaggerUI and following this link:

```javascript
https://obscure-peal.heroku.app/swagger-ui/
``` 
First, obtain an access token by running the /authenticate endpoint with username "user" and password "pass", which will grant you admin rights in the application.
